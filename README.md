# üëï Clothing Classification using Deep Learning

## üìñ Overview
This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model is trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately identify clothing categories such as shirts, dresses, sneakers, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement
Fashion MNIST is a dataset consisting of 60,000 grayscale images of clothing items belonging to 10 different categories. The goal of this project is to:
- Develop a CNN-based image classifier to categorize clothing items.
- Achieve high accuracy in predicting the correct category.
- Provide a robust model for fashion item recognition.

## ‚ú® Solution
- **Dataset:** Fashion MNIST (10 classes, 28x28 grayscale images).
- **Model Architecture:** CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
- **Training Approach:**
  - Data normalization and augmentation.
  - Use of ReLU activation and softmax for classification.
  - Optimization using Adam optimizer.
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy and loss metrics are analyzed on the test dataset.

---

## üìù Features
- **Deep Learning-based Classification:** Uses CNNs for high-accuracy predictions.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Normalization and augmentation for better generalization.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluation using accuracy, precision, and loss analysis.
